We serve a lot of different things like spaghetti, fish and chips, and the famous “Aunt Louise Salad”

And of course drinks, and more adult beverages

From time to time we have specials. So like, buy the lasagna and get a free side
of garlic knots. Or a couple slices of pizza with a free coke. Those change from
time to time, depending on what Charlies across the street is doing.

We will accept Charle’s coupons in addition to our own just cuz it ticks him off!

Anyway, now we take credit cards. We even have the swiper things, you know? Starting soon we can read the chip. 
I hate the chip. Takes too long. Kids always asking if they can pay with PayPal. 
I don’t know what that is. Can you let 
me know? 
It would be nice if we charged them once they picked up their food.

Loyalty - If you but 5 meals, you get the sixth on me
 It only counts if you get a main dish, a side and a drink.
No cheating like just 5 cokes then you get a free meal.

Ok so here’s what happens I think. A guy goes on our website and says what he
wants. It should be easy to pick his old favorite. Can we also remember what he
got last time in case he wants that? Or maybe something from the time before
that? How many can you guys remember? He should tell me how long it will take
him to get here cause some guys are coming from uptown, like 45 minutes away.

 we make our food fresh, so sometimes we need to start
ahead, others we make quick. It’s easy when they just show up and order, but if
they order ahead, phew, what a headache.

Anyway, we don’t start cooking until its time. We want to try to get the food to
be done just as the customer arrives. My cooks, I love ‘em, but they ain’t too
smart. Can you make them a list of what they need to start cooking next? Oh,
also, I only let food sit on the warmer only so long, depends on the food.

 sit in my office and sorta keep tabs on things. I’d like to know how
many orders we are waiting on, you know, they called but it’s not time to start
making it. I also want to know what’s being cooked and what’s on the warmer
waiting. Also, I need to know what was left on the warmer too long and had to
get thrown out and who ordered it. If someone orders but doesn’t pick up, that
ain’t too nice. I will remember them. They don’t get to order again until they come 
apologize

Catering - That’s just a bunch of orders at once, sometime like 50 or 100 but
once I got 150! I will apply a nice discount to a catering order, The more your
order, the bigger the discount.

So, I need a report every day of what I need to order. We have a bunch of stuff
in the back but I don’t want to run out of anything. - supplies/suppliers
